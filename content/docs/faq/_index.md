## What is the Cloud Resume Challenge?

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud **certification** to cloud **job**. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

## Who can complete the Cloud Resume Challenge?

Short answer: anybody! It's a fun way to level up your cloud skills, even if you're already a professional.

(It's extra impressive coming from folks brand-new to cloud, though!)

## Who are you and why are you doing this?

My name is [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com). I've been building in the cloud for many years. I would not be at this point in my career without the generous help of many people.

When I originally created the challenge I was working at [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com), a cloud education company, but this has always been a personal attempt to give back to the community. 

## Is there a deadline to complete the challenge?
Early versions of the challenge had a deadline to receive personal code review from Forrest. While that deadline has passed, you can always submit your projects in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/2PTwAth) to get reviews from the community.

## Can I do the challenge without buying the book?

The [core steps of the Cloud Resume Challenge](../the-challenge) are always free to access, and you are welcome to try them on your own.

The [book](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/book) is full of tools, tips, and resources to help you complete the challenge more quickly and get hired more easily. It also includes several bonus projects to further build your resume.

## Does completing the Cloud Resume Challenge guarantee I will get a job in the cloud?

No. But it has helped [a lot of folks](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/halloffame) along that road. Also, members of the community are active in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2PTwAth) and have helped others during the challenge. In addition to that, community members who've completed the challenge - "Champions" - are organizing to help with networking for spectrum of demand for talent in the cloud (frontend, backend, ops, etc.)

Now, fair warning: you will have to open a large number of browser tabs to figure out the challenge. It will take you quite a few long evenings at the kitchen table. You might reasonably conclude that none of it is worth the dubious reward of having a side project on your resume.

But if you give this project a try and realize that you hate it, or you're just not interested, you'll have learned a valuable lesson about whether or not you really want a career in the cloud -- because **these are the types of problems that real cloud engineers and developers really work on.**

And I believe that if you can, in good faith, complete the Cloud Resume Challenge, **you will already have more useful skills than a lot of people who graduate from university computer science programs.** Specifically: you will understand something about full-stack software development, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, continuous integration and delivery, cloud services and "serverless", application security, and networking. And you'll have learned by doing, because I didn't give you enough instructions to figure any of this out without going down some late-night rabbit holes. Most importantly, you will have demonstrated the number-one skill in a cloud engineer's toolbox: the ability to learn fast and google well.

Those are skills you can take to a job interview.

Good luck!

Yes! Feel free to use different cloud providers, DevOps tools, etc -- as long as you have met the end objective described in each step.

## Can I work on the steps in a different order?

Yep. As long as you are doing your own work, there's no wrong way to approach the challenge.

## Can I share my solutions online?

You are encouraged to share your general observations and personal approach to solving the challenge when you write your wrap-up blog post. However, I ask that you please don't share your Python and Javascript code in the blog. Let's keep the challenge properly challenging for others!

## What is the cloud, anyway?

Hey, I wrote another [book](https://www.amazon.com/Read-Aloud-Cloud-Innocents-Inside/dp/1119677629/) about that!
